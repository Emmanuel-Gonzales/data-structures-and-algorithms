Colaberated with Donna Ada

## Approach & Efficiency

We looked at our past linked list challanges and made our algorithim and test based on that

## Solution

Create a function called ZipList and pass in two arguments, linked-list-1, linked-list-2.
Create a new variable to store the zipped list.
create a loop to traverse through the first list and in each iteration, add the node to the zipped list.
In that same loop, we will create another loop to traverse through the 2nd list and in each iteration, add that node to the list after the first node.
