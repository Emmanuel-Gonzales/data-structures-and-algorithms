# Animal Shelter

Code Challenge 12 - Stack Queue Animal Shelter Today's assignment is to create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach. I will create a whiteboard for this process and then create a new class called AnimalShelter. I will then create a new instance of the Queue class. I will then create the required methods for the AnimalShelter class. No additional tests need to be written for today's assignment.

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

I started with a whiteboard of the AnimalShelter implementation. I then created an AnimalShelter class that will use a Queue class. I then created the required methods for the AnimalShelter class. I'll have to plug my methods into Chat GPT to get the Big O space/time for this approach. The following methods will have a Big O space/time complexity:
